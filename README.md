# Coding Interview Challenge
## Challenge Explanation
### Requirements
* Recieve a list of 100 integers with values between 1 and 10. 
* Return a 2-dimensional array list of integers with no duplicate integers in the first value and the number of occurrences of that integer within the recieved integer list as the second value for each ArrayList within the overarching ArrayList. 
* Also, order the ArrayLists within the Overarching ArrayList so that they decend in order of frequency. 

### Example input and output
For example, 6 of the integers you receive may be [4, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. 
* The 2D ArrayList that you return will be [[4,3],[2,2],[3,1]]. 
* Note: [4,3] appears first because the frequency of the occurrence of the number 4 is the highest out of all of the integers recieved. It is then followed by 2 which occurs twice and then 3 which occurs once.
